# Hebbian Learning
A biology inspired machine learning model. Weights of the model are adjusted similar to how neurons pathways are. In Donald Hebb's discovery, he said there is a correlation for the more times a neuron is fired, the higher strength it has. Same with the ML model that uses this as a basis.
